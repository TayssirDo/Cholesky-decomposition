# Cholesky-decomposition
The Cholesky decomposition is an efficient and reliable way to check if a symmetric matrix is positive definite. If a symmetric matrix is not positive definite, the Cholesky decomposition will fail.

> Theorem:
If $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is symmetric positive definite (SPD), then $A$ has a unique Cholesky decomposition:

$A = RTR$,

where $R \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is upper triangular with positive diagonal entries.
